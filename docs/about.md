I am the Director of Frontier Research at <a href="https://www.gene.com/prescient">Prescient Design / Genentech</a>. My research focuses on probabilistic machine learning for scientific discovery with applications in the life sciences. Previously I led Machine Learning at Pfizer, where I worked on developing methods for <a href="https://www.breakthroughs.com/disruptive-science/ni-hao-better-potential-medicines-how-language-translation-technology-being">problems in drug design</a>. My background is in statistical machine learning, having worked on my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Statistics, and I finished my graduate studies at Columbia University and undergraduate studies at Cornell University.
