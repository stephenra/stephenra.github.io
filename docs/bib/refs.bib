              cluster-based selection are used to select subsets containing
              between 1\% and 20\% of the file. Investigation of the numbers of
              bioactive molecules in the selected subsets suggest: that the
              MaxMin subsets are noticeably superior to the k-means subsets;
              that the property-based descriptors are marginally superior to
              the fragment-based descriptors; and that both approaches are
