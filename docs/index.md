I am the Director of Frontier Research at and part of the Founding Team of <a href="https://www.gene.com/prescient">Prescient Design, a Genentech Accelerator</a>, where I co-lead a team working on machine learning for scientific discovery. 
</p>
<p>
Previously, I was Head of Machine Learning at Pfizer R&D, where I built and led a research group focused on <a href="https://insights.pfizer.com/pfizer-is-using-ai-to-discover-breakthrough-medicines">developing methods for problems in drug discovery</a> including better adaptation for generative models and active learning. My background is in statistical machine learning and neuroscience, having worked on my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Statistics. I finished my graduate studies at Columbia University and undergraduate studies at Cornell University.
